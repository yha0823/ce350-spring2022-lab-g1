The AE-Lib has the following source Groups:

Documentation:
    It contains the following files:
    - Abstract.txt: this file
    - G99-TS100.log: the expected output from ae_tasks100_G99.c test suite    
AE:     
    It contains auto-tester general purpose routines. 
    You may change the implementation as long as you keep the interface of functions unchanged. 
    The files are:    
    - ae.c: the auto-tester initialization routines
    - ae_util.c: the auto-tester utility functions
    - ae_tasks_util.c: the auto-tester task tests related utility function
    - main.c the main.c used by the auto-tester. 

AE-inactive-staff: 
    It contains testing suites released by lab staff. By default, this source group is excluded from the build.
    The staff written testing cases takes the Group ID number of 99 in the file name. 
    The naming convention of the staff written testing suite is ae_tasks<suite ID>_Group99.c.
    For example:
    ae_tasks100_G99.c is Test Suite 100 by Group 99, which is the lab teaching team.
    The suite IDs in the range [100, 499] are reserved for the teaching team.

AE-inatctive-stu:
    It contains students' testing suites. Each testing suit is in a separate .c file. 
    The naming convention is ae_tasks<suite ID>_G<group id>.c.  For example
    ae_tasks1_Gxx.c is the Test Suite 1 from Group xx, where xx is the group ID number.
    By default, this source group is excluded from the build.
    
    Student test suite ID needs to be in the range of [0, 99] and [500, 0xFFFFFFFF]
    Note suite IDs in the range [100, 499] are reserved for the teaching team.
    Students should not use suite IDs in this range.
    
    
AE-active:
    It contains the active testing suite that you want to use.
    By default, it contains ae_tasks.c which is the initial dummy test suite written by lab teaching team to get starter code working.
    When you want to use test suites in AE-public or AE-stu source groups, drag the ae_tasks.c to AE-inactive-public folder and 
    drag the corresponding test suite file to the AE-active soruce group.
    By default, this source group is included from the build.
    
IMPORTANT    
    When submit, you should 
    - Put ae_tasks.c as the only file in AE-active folder 
    - include the following groups in the build
        * AE
        * AE-active
    - exclude the following groups in the build
        * AE-inactive-public
        * AE-inactive-stu
    - Enable compliation macros as follows:
        * ECE350_P1: for P1 
        * ECE350_P2: for P2 
        * ECE350_P3: for P3 
        * ECE350_P4: for P4
